This is a project where I am required to build a responsive skilled e-learning landing page by Amalitech GH in their Graduate Trainee Program.

Design files were given us through figma and we are supposed to build the same thing or something closely the same to it.


This is in partial fulfillment to the requirements at Training Phase 1 for the GTP.

This project requires that I use only HTML and CSS to achieve the said goal, and provision of a live link which I will share with the community.All files to be used have been given to me.
